#first we need to create an object that binds the transcript names to the gene names. In our case the GTF and GFF3 files don't have gene names, but here we go:

TxDb <- makeTxDbFromGFF(file = "C:/Users/Amy/Desktop/MvBLg_v2.0.gff3")
k <- keys(TxDb, keytype = "TXNAME")
tx2gene <- AnnotationDbi::select(TxDb, k, "GENEID", "TXNAME")
head(tx2gene)


#create a named vector to point to the quantification files. We will create a vector of filenames first by reading in a table that contains the sample IDs, and then combining this with dir and "quant.sf.gz"
samples <- read.table(file.path(dir, "samples.txt"), header = TRUE)
samples

#we need to construct a data frame called "tx2gene" that includes two columns, the transcript ID and the gene ID. I think that we can do this from the GFF file:
